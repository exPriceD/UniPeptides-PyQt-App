# UniPeptides
A program for searching for biologically active peptides in proteins by parsing the site uniprot.org . The program can help a lot if you need to learn about peptides in a large number of proteins, you just need to enter the names of the proteins and peptides that you are looking for. As a result, you will get an excel table for each protein, which contains the most basic information about the protein and its peptides.
